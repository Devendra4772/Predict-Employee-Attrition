# 📊 Predict Employee Attrition using Machine Learning

This project uses the *IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance* dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a key challenge for businesses. Predicting which employees are at risk of leaving helps companies improve retention strategies and reduce turnover costs.

In this project:
- We preprocess HR data
- Apply a *Logistic Regression model*
- Evaluate the model using *Accuracy, Precision, Recall*
- Visualize results using a *confusion matrix heatmap*

---

**Features include:**
- Demographics (e.g., Age, Gender, MaritalStatus)
- Job details (e.g., JobRole, JobLevel, EnvironmentSatisfaction)
- Compensation (e.g., MonthlyIncome, PercentSalaryHike)
- Work experience (e.g., TotalWorkingYears, YearsAtCompany)
- Target label: Attrition (Yes/No)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Google Colab
